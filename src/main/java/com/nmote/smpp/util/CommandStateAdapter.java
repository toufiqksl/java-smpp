 * CommandStateAdapter is an adapter class that implements CommandStateListener

 * are empty, subclasses (perhaps anonymous) should overide methods they are
 * interested in.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Followin example shows how to use this class when submitting message
 * asynchronously:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Command submit = new Command(req);
 *
 * // Set a CommandStateListener that will be called when
 * // command completes execution
 * submit.setCommandStateListener(new CommandStateAdapter() {
 * 	public void executed(Command cmd) {
 * 		SubmitSmRespPDU resp = (SubmitSmRespPDU) cmd.getResponse();
 * 		System.out.println(&quot;Status &quot; + resp.getStatus());
 * 		System.out.println(&quot;Message ID &quot; + resp.getMessageId());
 * 	}
 * });
 *
 * // Execute command asynchronously
 * s.executeAsync(submit);
 * </pre>
